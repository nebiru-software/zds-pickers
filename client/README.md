## Live Development

### Hot Reloading

Hot reloading is enabled by default when the application is running in development mode (`yarn start`).

## Testing

To add a unit test, create a `.spec.js` file alongside the unit.
To run the tests and also generate the coverage report, use:

```bash
$ yarn test
```

It is assumed you have `jest` installed globally in order to use its CLI.

## Deployment

Deployment is simple and all the files are static. To generate the build, use:

```bash
$ yarn build
```

All assets are automatically hashed based on file contents.
